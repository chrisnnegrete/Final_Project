# Generative Sculpture #

## Introduction ##

Generative design is the future of product development and manufacturing. Although in its infancy, generative design can be found in the real world.
Adidas Futurecraft shoes, architectural models, and industrial design concepts are just a few areas where generative design exists. As an industrial
design major, one of the things I want to explore is always form development. I believe generative design can be a helpful tool in furthering my exploration
of what is possible in modern manufacturing and concept development.

## Summary ##

My proposal is to create a series of sculptures with mechanical elements that are linked together with generative design. A few ideas that come to mind are
concept aircraft and spaceships, primitive sculptures, or structural models created in Autodesk Fusion360 with emohasis on using the generative design tools.
These models will then be prepared for presentation through 3D printing either full-size or scale models, depending upon the time frame, in addition to product
renders in Keyshot 8.

## Component Parts ##

To begin, every design starts with inspiration and sketches. First, I need to find an area of study that interests me to base my designs off, like geometric primitives
or science fiction. Sketching quick concepts will allow for reference when modeling in Fusion 360.

On the software side, I'll need to learn as much as I can about the generative design tools in Fusion 360. 3D modeling in general is a skill I have been developing
for a few years now, so that won't be as much of an obstacle for me. Rendering in Keyshot may have to be optional for me, again depending upon the timeline.

On the hardware side, I plan to 3D print these final models if possible and photograph them for presentation.

## Timeline ##

Week 1: Sketch concepts, begin 3D modeling in Fusion360

Week 2: Continue modeling, begin rendering and 3D printing

Week 3: Final presentation
